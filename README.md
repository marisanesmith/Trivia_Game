# Trivia_Game

The purpose of this project is to build a trivia game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The objective is to correctly answer questions relating to Javascript. If the user does not answer the question correctly then 15 seconds will be subtracted from the clock. 

The player will be able to play as many times as they want and save their score by entering their initials to local storage. The goal is to be able to view their highscores as it compares to other users highscores.
